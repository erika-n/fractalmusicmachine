SoundLab is a fractal music generator and music experimentation platform. 
  
It contains:

SoundLabUI:
	A user interface for creating fractals. 
SoundLabBasics:
	A library of useful sound tools, including oscillators, wav file import/export, 
	sound buffer, and envelope. 
FractalProject:
	The actual fractal making engine. 
	Contains a command line utility for making fractals, and also is the back end for SoundLabUI.

This is very much an alpha release. If something seems broken it probably is. If something seems not to make sense, it probably doesn't.
